This website provides changes to the code clarity and access to Horiseon's services
Here is a list of the changes:
1. Added commentary lines according to standards above or ones you’ve used before. (AS YOU GO, but sweep it every so often to make sure it makes sense).

2. Changed div in body from <div class=“header”> to <header>
	
3. Changed CSS lines corresponding to html changes for header only
4. Changed <div> of anchor elements in header  of  former to <nav>


5. Checked code for logical flow: 

	-Indentation DONE
	-logical subdivisions of code in the tree. 

4. Made accessible alt attributes for image elements.

	-By accessible, they could mean accessibility attributes to accommodate more individuals
	-I gave 3 of the images alt attributes with meaning, I gave the other 3 alt=“” because the images are just for
	decoration

5. Make sure heading attributes fall in sequential order. 
6. Fixed the title element to make it more descriptive, but still concise. 

	-I CHOSE “Horiseon” BECAUSE
	THAT’S THE NAME OF THE
	COMPANY
